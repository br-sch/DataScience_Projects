# DataScience_Projects
A collection of machine learning projects focused on predicting behavior.
These projects use raw CSV data, applying techniques like data cleaning, encoding, and analysis to prepare the data for models such as XGBoost and Decision Trees.
The goal is to compare the performance of different models in making accurate predictions.
